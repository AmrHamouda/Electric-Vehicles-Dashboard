This project provides an analytical overview of electric vehicle (EV) adoption in the U.S., focusing on both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The insights derived help understand market trends, manufacturer performance, and the influence of environmental incentives.

üìä Key Metrics & Insights

Total Vehicles
Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles by analyzing the total count of both BEVs and PHEVs. This metric helps assess the market size and growth over time.

Average Electric Range
Calculate the average electric range across all EVs in the dataset to evaluate technological advancements and the efficiency of modern electric vehicles.

Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total

Count of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs).

Percentage of BEVs relative to total EVs.
This helps identify the dominance of fully electric models in the market.

Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total

Count of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

Percentage of PHEVs relative to total EVs.
This metric gives insight into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
